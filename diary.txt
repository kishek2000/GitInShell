27/06/2020	5:55pm		6:10pm		coding			                Just getting shrug-init working, excited to get started on this!
""/""/""""  9:00pm      9:45pm      coding		    	            Continued work on subset 0. Init, add, commit and log working. 
                                                                    Show is todo.

28/06/2020  12:00pm  	12:38pm		coding	    		            Finished off subset 0!!
""/""/""""	1:30pm		3:00pm		debugging/testing	            Finally succeeded with the basic autotests for subset 0 and understood 
                                                                    some parallels with git through use of reference implementation.

29/06/2020	11:30am		12:10pm		coding and testing	            Succeeded in simple passes for shrug-commit with the -a option in subset 
                                                                    1, and succeeded in some simple manual tests of shrug-status. next up 
                                                                    - shrug-rm!

30/06/2020  1:30pm      4:13pm      coding, testing, debugging      Worked through all of subset 1 and passed all but the final autotest. 
                                                                    Strange bug happening, will investigate further soon.
""/""/""""  6:30pm      8:20pm      debugging                       Ahhhhh subset1_18 this autotest had me very annoyed hahaha. 
                                                                    It actually unveiled a lot of logical flaws - all fixed, onto

2/07/2020   4:00pm      4:40pm      coding, investigating           Had a day break and now started on subset 2 - realised that the way I

3/07/2020   5:00pm      5:53pm      coding                          Did some more work on shrug branch and checkout, some good

5/07/2020   3:00pm      6:21pm      coding, testing, debugging      Passed all the tests for branch and checkout! Started to experiment with

11/07/2020  3:30pm      5:30pm      coding, testing, debugging      Took a looong break, but I'm back!! Finally passed some tests for git 
                                                                    merge! Been a while, decided to really buckle up and give it a go.

""/""/""""  8:00pm         -        pushing version onto git        Only now, have I realised I was required to submit intermediate versions
                                                                    of work :(. To you who is reading this, please let me know if I require

13/07/2020  12:30pm     4:56pm      coding, testing, debugging      As in my pushed git message, i did some further testing and finally 
                                    and writing tests.              started to write some tests. Today, i wanted to complete my idea about
                                                                    the merge where i needed to check if i actually account for consecutive
