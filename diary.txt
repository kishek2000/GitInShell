30/06/2020  1:30pm      4:13pm      coding, testing, debugging      Worked through all of subset 1 and passed all but the final autotest.

2/07/2020   4:00pm      4:40pm      coding, investigating           Had a day break and now started on subset 2 - realised that the way I

11/07/2020  3:30pm      5:30pm      coding, testing, debugging      Took a looong break, but I'm back!! Finally passed some tests for git
